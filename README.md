To create an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, follow these steps. This example will include a basic setup where a user can input an OTP code sent to their email.

1. HTML
Create a basic structure for your OTP verification form
2.CSS
Add styling to your form to make it look more appealing.
3.JavaScript
Add functionality to handle the OTP verification.

OTP Generation and Sending: In a real-world application, OTPs are generated and sent to users through a server-side script. This example assumes the OTP is hardcoded for demonstration purposes. You'll need a backend service to generate and send OTPs.

Security: Ensure proper security practices are followed when implementing OTP verification. This includes using HTTPS and implementing rate limiting and logging to prevent abuse.

Validation: Additional client-side validation and user feedback should be implemented to enhance user experience.

Backend Integration: For a complete implementation, integrate this front-end code with a backend server that handles OTP generation, validation, and sending.
